# TODO

- [ ] Filter per shortest path tree (`[NonEmpty Function]`): if exists a path (`[Function]`) using only functions from `src` or `dst` package then ignore the other results in the shortest path tree
- [x] Prioritize functions from the same package as the from/to type
- [ ] Prioritize functions from 'existing' dependencies (ie. take a list of dependencies for which functions are prioritized higher)
